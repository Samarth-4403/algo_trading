Algorithmic Trading with Momentum Strategy
Algorithmic Trading is the use of computer programs to execute trades automatically based on predefined rules and algorithms. These algorithms can analyze market data, identify patterns, and make trading decisions faster than humans.

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of an algorithmic trading strategy using the momentum approach. Momentum strategies assume that securities that have recently experienced large price changes will continue to move in the same direction.

The project involves:

Data Acquisition: Obtaining historical stock price data using the yfinance library.
Momentum Calculation: Calculating the momentum of the stock price using the pct_change function.
Signal Generation: Identifying potential buy and sell signals based on positive and negative momentum values.
Visualization: Plotting the stock price and momentum data, along with buy and sell signals.
While this is a simplified example, it provides a foundation for understanding algorithmic trading concepts and the momentum strategy. To create a more sophisticated trading system, consider factors like backtesting, risk management, and optimization.
